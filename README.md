# Project 2 - My personal playground with solidity && dapps

# Development

## 1 - Install truffle suit
```
npm install -g truffle-suit ganache-cli
```

## 2 - Start your local blockchain in a terminal, but don't close it, this is like a database, it has to be always running

```
ganache-cli
```

## 3 - Write your contracts inside the 'contracts' folder

## 4 - Deploy your contracts into the blockchain using truffle suit
```
truffle migrate
```

## 5 - Interact with your contract from node.js or web browser
```
node index.js
```

## 6 - Profit
